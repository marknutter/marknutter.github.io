and steel is worth it's wait in gold.  Foul new creatures have been born to Athas, creating 
an unforgiving envirenment to those who attempt to survive.  Powerfull sorcerer kings, and enormous city-states
lie on this scorched world of sand and silt.  By mine, and many other's opinions, Dark Sun is by far the most
exciting world TSR has created.</FONT></CENTER>
